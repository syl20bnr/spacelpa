;;; Commentary:

;; MWIM stands for "Move Where I Mean".  This package is inspired by
;; <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackToIndentationOrBeginning>.  It
;; provides commands to switch between various positions on the current
;; line (particularly, to move to the beginning/end of code, line or
;; comment).

;; To install the package manually, add the following to your init file:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mwim-dir")
;;   (autoload 'mwim "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-beginning "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-end "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line-or-comment "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)

;; Then you can bind some keys to some of those commands and start
;; moving.  See README in the source repo for more details.

  "Function used to define the next position.

This function is called with a list of functions returning
available point positions as a single argument.  It should return
the next position where the point will be moved.

There are 2 functions to choose from: `mwim-next-position' and
`mwim-next-unique-position'.

`mwim-next-position' is faster as it calculates positions only
when needed, however there are some special cases when this
function will not return an expected position (when there are
more than 3 potential positions, and some of them are the same).

With `mwim-next-unique-position' you will always switch between
all available positions, but it is slower as it calculates all
positions at once.  Most likely, however, this slowness will be
insignificant as the number of potential positions is not big.

If this variable is nil, an appropriate function will be chosen
automatically.  This is the recommended value, as it provides the
speed when possible, and guaranteed cycling between all positions
for complex cases."
