;;; Commentary:

;; These definitions let you interact with SWI-Prolog in all buffers.
;; You can consult Prolog programs and evaluate embedded queries.

;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; Copy ediprolog.el to your load-path and add to your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'ediprolog)
;;     (global-set-key [f10] 'ediprolog-dwim)
;;
;; Restart Emacs and customize ediprolog with
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET ediprolog RET
;;

;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; The central function is `ediprolog-dwim' (Do What I Mean), which is
;; bound to F10 by the snippet above. Depending on the content at
;; point, `ediprolog-dwim' does the "appropriate" thing: If point is
;; on a query, F10 sends the query to a Prolog process, and you
;; interact with the process in the current buffer as on a terminal.
;; Queries start with "?-" or ":-", possibly preceded by "%" and
;; whitespace. An example of a query is (without leading ";;"):
;;
;;   %?- member(X, [a,b,c]).
;;
;; If you press F10 when point is on that query, you get:
;;
;;   %?- member(X, [a,b,c]).
;;   %@ X = a ;
;;   %@ X = b ;
;;   %@ X = c ;
;;   %@ false.
;;
;; When waiting for output of the Prolog process, you can press C-g to
;; unblock Emacs and continue with other work. To resume interaction
;; with the Prolog process, use M-x ediprolog-toplevel RET.

;; If you press F10 when point is *not* on a query, the buffer content
;; is consulted in the Prolog process, and point is moved to the first
;; error (if any).  In transient mark mode, if the region is active,
;; only the text in the region is consulted.

;; For convenience, the most recent interactions with the Prolog
;; process are logged in the buffer "*ediprolog-history*".

;; Use M-x ediprolog-localize RET to make any Prolog process started
;; in the current buffer buffer-local. This way, you can run distinct
;; processes simultaneously. Revert with M-x ediprolog-unlocalize RET.

;; `ediprolog-dwim' with prefix arguments has special meanings:
;;
;;   C-0 F10       kill Prolog process
;;   C-1 F10       always consult buffer (even when point is on a query)
;;   C-2 F10       always consult buffer, using a new process
;;   C-7 F10       equivalent to `ediprolog-toplevel'
;;   C-u F10       first consult buffer, then evaluate query (if any)
;;   C-u C-u F10   like C-u F10, with a new process

;; Tested with SWI-Prolog 7.3.21 + Emacs 22.1, 23.4, 24.5, 25.1 and 26.0

;;;; ChangeLog:

;; 2017-06-11  Markus Triska  <triska@metalevel.at>
;; 
;; 	* ediprolog/ediprolog.el (ediprolog-version): Bump to 1.2
;; 
;; 	(ediprolog-query): Use undo-amalgamate-change-group when available.
;; 	(ediprolog-remove-interactions, ediprolog-consult): Improve docstring.
;; 
;; 2016-07-11  Paul Eggert	 <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
;; 
;; 	Fix some quoting problems in doc strings
;; 
;; 	Most of these are minor issues involving, e.g., quoting `like this' 
;; 	instead of 'like this'.	 A few involve escaping ` and ' with a preceding
;; 	\= when the characters should not be turned into curved single quotes.
;; 
;; 2015-09-23  Dmitry Gutov  <dgutov@yandex.ru>
;; 
;; 	ediprolog: Don't autoload variables
;; 
;; 2015-09-23  Dmitry Gutov  <dgutov@yandex.ru>
;; 
;; 	Update ediprolog to the latest release
;; 
;; 2011-12-22  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
;; 
;; 	Add new package "ediprolog".
;; 


(provide 'ediprolog)
