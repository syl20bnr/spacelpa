;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minor mode to apply the suggestions from
;; hlint.
;;
;; To activate it use (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'hlint-refactor-mode).

;;; Code:

(defun hlint-refactor-call-process-region-checked (start end program &optional args)
  "Send text from START to END to PROGRAM with ARGS.
This is a wrapper around `call-process-region' that doesn't replace
the region with the output of PROGRAM if it returned a non-zero
exit code."

                     start end

                     t                  ; send output to buffer
                     nil                ; no redisplay during output
