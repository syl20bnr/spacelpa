;;; Commentary:

;; Grizzl provides a fuzzy completion framework for general purpose
;; use in Emacs Lisp projects.
;;
;; grizzl provides the underlying data structures and sesrch
;; algorithm without any UI attachment.  At the core, a fuzzy search
;; index is created from a list of strings, using `grizzl-make-index'.
;; A fuzzy search term is then used to get a result from this index
;; with `grizzl-search'.  Because grizzl considers the usage of a
;; fuzzy search index to operate in real-time as a user enters a
;; search term in the minibuffer, the framework optimizes for this use
;; case.  Any result can be passed back into `grizzl-search' as a hint
;; to continue searching.  The search algorithm is able to understand
;; insertions and deletions and therefore minimizes the work it needs
;; to do in this case.  The intended use here is to collect a result
;; on each key press and feed that result into the search for the next
;; key press. Once a search is complete, the matched strings are then
;; read, using `grizzl-result-strings'. The results are ordered on the
;; a combination of the Levenshtein Distance and a character-proximity
;; scoring calculation. This means shorter strings are favoured, but
;; adjacent letters are more heavily favoured.
;;
;; It is assumed that the index will be re-used across multiple
;; searches on larger sets of data.
;;
;; Call `grizzl-completing-read' with an index returned by
;; `grizzl-make-index':
;;
;;    (defvar *index* (grizzl-make-index '("one" "two" "three")))
;;    (grizzl-completing-read "Number: " *index*)
;;
;; When the user hits ENTER, either one of the strings is returned on
;; success, or nil of nothing matched.
;;
;; The arrow keys can be used to navigate within the results.
