KEYS: Candidate display strings with no properties.

COMPANY-CANDIDATE is the candidate string exactly as provided by
company-backend (properties and all); FORMATTED-DISPLAY is the
formatted display string (with font-lock properties) of
COMPANY-CANDIDATE, for Helm to display.

Some completion backends use string properties to store and
retrieve annotation data. Helm strips all properties off before
completion, which may break this feature. So, the original
strings provided by company-backend are stored here, so they can
be retrieved and passed to company-backend when asking for
annotations.")
