;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds support for Elixir mix to flycheck.
;; To use it, add to your init.el:
;;
;; (require 'flycheck-mix)
;; (flycheck-mix-setup)
;;
;; Elixir compilation uses macros and it can run arbitrary code.
;; You should use =elixir-mix= checker only with trusted projects.

;;; Code:
(require 'flycheck)
